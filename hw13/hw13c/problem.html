<div><p>In this problem, you will implement an <em>immutable set</em>. The <code>add</code> and <code>remove</code> methods don't mutate the set but instead return a new set with the given element added or removed.</p>
  <p>At first glance, that sounds horribly inefficient. But you can share a lot of structure between the two sets. And the sharing is safe because nothing is ever mutated. You'll be happy to know that there is never a reason to throw a ConcurrentModificationException!</p>
  <p>Here is how you can share structure.</p>
  <p>All buckets that don't contain the added or removed element can be shared.</p>
  <p>When adding an element, you can share the entire old node sequence and just add the new node in front.</p>
  <p>When removing an element, you need to make fresh copies of the nodes preceding the removed node, and you can share the nodes following it.</p>
  <p>Finally, if an operation doesn't make any change, return the <code>HashSet</code> instance.</p>

  〈p Implement a 〈 Ring〉 data structure. 〉
  〈p 〈img src=ring.png〉〉
  〈p One can get and set a value under the start position, and move the start position forward or backward.〉
  〈p The 〈 add〉 method adds an element before the start position.〉
  〈p The 〈 remove〉 method removes the element at the start position, and the next element becomes the start position.〉
  〈p In the draft, only implement a ring of size 3, and don't implement 〈 add〉/〈 remove〉.〉

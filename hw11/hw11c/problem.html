<div><p>The Java-style list iterators have to remember complex state for <code>remove</code> and <code>set</code>. That makes them hard to understand and use. Other collection libraries have much simpler iterators. In this exercise, you will implement one. To avoid confusion, we'll call it a list pointer.</p>
  <p>A list pointer points to an element. As with iterators, you can move it forward and backward. Call <code>get</code> to get the data to which the pointer points, or <code>set</code> to change it. The <code>add</code> method adds an element before the pointer. The <code>remove</code> method removes the element at the pointer and moves the pointer to the next position. You can call these methods as often as you like without having to call <code>next</code> or <code>previous</code> in between.</p>
  <p>Note that for a list of length n there are n + 1 valid pointer positions: the n elements and after the last element. You cannot get, set, or remove at that position, but you can add.</p>

  <p>Draft: Only implement <code>next</code>, <code>hasNext</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>set</code>.</p>

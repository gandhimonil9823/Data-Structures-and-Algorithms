Make the Point class implement the Measurable interface. The measure is the distance of the point from the origin.

The draft should simply return 0 in all cases.

Use the following files:

Measurable.java

/**
   Describes any class whose objects can be measured.
*/
public interface Measurable
{
   /**
      Computes the measure of the object.
      @return the measure
   */
   double getMeasure();
}
PointTester.java

public class PointTester
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      Point p1 = new Point(3, 4);
      Point p2 = new Point(13, 84);
      Measurable p3 = new Point(65, 72);

      System.out.println(p1.getMeasure());
      System.out.println("Expected: 5");
      System.out.println(p2.getMeasure());
      System.out.println("Expected: 85");
      System.out.println(p3.getMeasure());
      System.out.println("Expected: 97");
   }
}

Write a program that reads a text file and prints the number of words and sentences in the file.

A sentence ends in a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. But an ellipsis (...) is not the end of a sentence, so don't count it. Count any sequence of two or more . as an ellipsis (.., ..., ...., etc.).

A word consists of only upper- and lowercase letters and apostrophes.

The input

"What's up?", he said. I didn't know--and don't think I was ever going to know...that's just how I am.
has 21 words and 3 sentences.

For the draft, read input from System.in and only count the words, using a relaxed definition for words, namely any sequence of non-whitespace characters. That's what you get when you call in.next() where in is an instance of Scanner.

With that definition of words, the input above has 19 words.

For the final version, first prompt the user for a file name and then read a character at a time from that file.

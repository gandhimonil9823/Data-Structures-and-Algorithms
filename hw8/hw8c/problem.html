<div><p>Complete the methods in the <code>Lists</code> utility class.</p>
  <p>There is only one method for the draft, and you can do it without knowing much about linked lists.</p>
  <p>As you can see from the tester, <code>addLast</code> adds an element to the end of a linked list.</p>
  <p>Traversing a linked list is very similar to using a scanner. Except, you use a list iterator. Here is the outline of the loop that you need:</p>
  <pre>ListIterator&lt;String&gt; iter = b.listIterator();
while (iter.hasNext())
{
   ...
   String nextElement = iter.next();
   ...
}</pre>
  <p>By the time the final rolls around, you will have had a lecture on lists, and you'll know what to do.</p>
</div>

<div><p>The Bulgarian sort method relies on the fact that it's easy to sort an array of length 3. If <code>a[0]</code> and <code>a[1]</code> are out of order, swap them. If <code>a[1]</code> and <code>a[2]</code> are out of order, swap them. One more compare-and-swap (that you get to figure out), and you are done.</p><p>

Implement the following algorithm:</p>
  <pre>
While the array is not sorted
   For each adjacent triple of elements starting at 0, 2, 4, 6, ...
      Sort the triple
</pre>
<p>Submit a file BulgarianSorter.java. In the draft, just implement the <code>sortTriple</code> method.</p>

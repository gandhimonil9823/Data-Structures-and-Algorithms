<p>Write a method that prints a tree sideways. For example, the tree in figure 1 would be printed:<pre>
George
+--Edward VIII
+--George VI
|  +--Elizabeth II
|  |  +--Charles
|  |  |  +--William
|  |  |  +--Harry
|  |  +--Anne
|  |  |  +--Peter
|  |  |  |  +--Savannah
|  |  |  +--Zara
|  |  +--Andrew
|  |  |  +--Beatrice
|  |  +--Edward
|  |     +--Louise
|  |     +--Severn
|  +--Margreth
+--Mary
+--Henry
|  +--Richard
...
</pre></p>
<p>Pay attention to the | lines and note that they stop after the last node (e.g. look at the line of Louise).</p>

<p><b>Hint:</b>Use a recursive helper

<pre>public void print(String prefix)</pre>

in the Node class, where <code>prefix</code> is the pattern of | that precedes a line, such as</p><pre>"|  |     "</pre><p>in front of Louise.</p>

<p>The TreeReader reads a tree in the format (data child1 child2 ... childn). For example:</p>
<pre>
     Fred
    /    \
Wilma   Barney
</pre>

<p>should be typed in from command line as: (Fred (Wilma) (Barney))
Be aware of the parentheses around each node, including the leaves.</p>

<p>Draft: Print a tree with a root and two leaves correctly.</p>
